**NLP Sentiment Classifier — IMDB Movie Reviews
**
Bi-LSTM | Bi-GRU | CNN-1D | Custom Embeddings | TensorFlow

A deep learning–based sentiment analysis system built on the IMDB movie review dataset. This project benchmarks multiple neural architectures (Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, CNN-1D) to classify reviews as positive or negative, and explores how preprocessing, embeddings, and regularization influence model performance.

**Project Highlights**

-Implemented three advanced architectures for sentiment classification:

-Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)

-Bi-GRU (Bidirectional GRU)

-CNN-1D (Convolutional Neural Network)

-Designed a custom text preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, stop-word removal, and sequence padding.

-Integrated pre-trained embeddings and experimented with custom-trained embeddings.

-Achieved 90%+ test accuracy after hyperparameter tuning and regularization (Dropout + EarlyStopping).

-Performed model benchmarking to compare training time, accuracy, and generalization performance.
